量る hakaru - to measure; to weigh; to survey; to time (sound, gauge, estimate)

Python tool collection to monitor a metrics stream and alert on thresholds.

This tool is being designed to be put into the middle of any existing metrics
gathering and monitoring system, but it also has basic default tools if you don't
have any current systems. Think of it as an introduction to metrics and monitoring
that is basic and self-contained (or at least that is the plan. ;)

Roadmap
